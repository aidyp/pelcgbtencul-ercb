# Useful Links

### Purpose

This document is where you should add useful links that you have found during your search to solve bugs and other issues. The aim here is two-fold:

- So you don't forget any useful links you find
- So others can have a look through and see if their issue has been talked about at some point

### Format

When you've found a link that really helped you, you should format it in the below table, like so. For brevity, please use hyperlinks to just have the website (use CTRL+K)
