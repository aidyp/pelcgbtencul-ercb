# Useful Links

### Purpose

This document is where you should add useful links that you have found during your search to solve bugs. Please *only* include links that you found *extremely helpful*. Ignore links that were a dud. The purpose of this is twofold,

- So you can keep track of useful links you've found
- So other people can find the right links rather than trawl through the web

### Format

When you've found a link that really helped you, you should format it in the below table, like so. For brevity, please use hyperlinks to just have the website (use CTRL+K)
